# Amino Acid Haplotype Characterization

## Introduction
Struggling to analyze your amino acid alignments? This R script simplifies counting unique haplotypes and calculating their frequencies, both overall and within defined populations.

## Features
- Unique haplotype identification: Efficiently identify and count distinct amino acid combinations.
- Frequency calculations: Get population-level and individual haplotype frequencies with ease.
- Flexible grouping: Analyze haplotypes by predefined or custom population groups.

## Future Plans
- Add amino acid haplotype diversity metrics (different from nucleotide diversity indices).
- Add user-defined sequence filtering options for more granular analysis.

## Contribute
We welcome feedback and suggestions for future features! Open an issue or pull request on the project repository.
